# C++ or C
C and C++ are programming languages that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. Both languages are considered "low-level" languages, meaning they provide a close-to-the-metal programming experience and allow developers to have a lot of control over the hardware and software.

C is a procedural language that is known for its efficiency and simplicity. It is often used for developing system software, such as operating systems, device drivers, and firmware.

C++ is an object-oriented language that is an extension of C. It adds features such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, which allow developers to create more complex and modular software. C++ is often used for developing high-performance applications, such as games, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and scientific simulations.

Both C and C++ are still widely used today, although they have been surpassed by newer languages in some areas. They are popular choices for developing system-level software and high-performance applications, and they are used by companies such as Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe.
